  <h1>Hello, I'm Loup</h1>

  <p>
Hello, my name is Loup, like the wolf in English. I'm 19 years old, I like to play tennis, listen to music, play video games, watch series and eat good food. I am in a business school called EMLV.

  <h2>Series</h2>
  <p>
I watch a lot of series, of all kinds because I am very open-minded. At the moment, I'm watching Desperate Housewives, Lupin, and an anime called attack of the titans.

  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>
I listen to a lot of music, of many different styles. My favorites are pop and disco, because I like it when it's danceable and rhythmic.

  <h2>Video games</h2>
  <p>
I have played many games in my life. My favorite ones are the ones where you can move wherever you want, called "open world games". Again, I like any style, I can mention for example Call of Duty, The Sims, or Getting Over It.
